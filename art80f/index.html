                    This crazy thumbs-up man and I have a little history together.
                    I originally stumbled across him while searching for visuals for a <a href="resources/FLOSS.pdf">poster project</a>.
                    In the poster, he represents a developer in an Open Source community which is naturally an accurate representation of myself.

                <h1>Critique of Practice</h1>
                <h2>Kara Walker</h2>
                <p>
                    Kara Walker uses construction paper to create silhouettes of people and places in scenes of different periods from the past.
                    Each scene illustrates a dialectic of presence and absence while incorporating a blurry contrast between the pleasantly uplifting and the uncomfortably morbid.
                    The dialectic, built into each scene by the medium of choice, adds a voyeuristic sense of excitement and suspense to the safety of a static image.
                    It also alludes to a void between a scene and its context through a theme of black paper on white walls or vice versa.
                    The difficulty in denying the presence of the topic of race and ethnicity increases as a viewer then becomes more familiar with Kara's work.
                    She often manipulates the way in which scenes are fed to her audience in order to draw them in.
                    Some examples of these tactics include using
                        <span class="red strike">overhead</span>
                        <span class="green">strategic</span>
                    lighting to create silhouettes of viewers by projecting their shadows on the walls of her art,
                    encompassing her viewers with
                        <span class="red strike">circular settings that wrap around 360 degrees literally immersing</span>
                        <span class="green">cycloramas that literally immerse</span>
                    her audience,
                    and relating to people by depicting scenes based on historical events.
                    All of these ploys seem to, in some ways, encourage a kind of identity tourism perhaps with the goal of instilling a sense of understanding or connection.
                    However, the dialectic simultaneously causes a disconnect by withholding information about the details of the symbols represented by each silhouette.
                    In many cases, Kara has said she acknowledges a feeling of <q>avoiding the subject</q> and distance with the characters portrayed in her pieces.
                    <span class="green">
                    The most prominently avoided subject is racism, and it is evident in a number of ways.
                    By using the same colored paper, Walker alludes to the topic of colorblindness, a common way to refer to the disregarding of race when interacting with others.
                    She makes a statement that attempts to invalidate the topic through her depiction of settings that carry connotations of racism like the flora and architecture of the antebellum South.
                    Showing that racism goes deeper than aesthetics forces a viewer to consider other factors of race and ethnicity that cause inequality.
                    Her use of black paper to illustrate racism predominantly against blacks also introduces a sense of unsettling irony.
                    When all of this is taken in at once, it makes a strong point about the difference between a lack of inequality and the facade of a lack.

                <h1>Literature Review</h1>
                <h2><cite>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</cite><br>Walter Benjamin</h2>
                <p>
                    In this piece, Benjamin discusses the effects of reproduction on the value of art.
                    He begins by noting that there has been an evolution in the technical means people possess to reproduce works created with various different mediums.
                    In light of the advent of the Internet, perhaps now has never been a more relevant time to discuss such an observation;
                    however, the fact that this article was written in 1935 adds some irony when considering the <q>prognostic value</q> Benjamin attributes to Marx's work.
                    Digital art and data has become more easily reproducible than ever before, and distributing duplicates is often just as easy.
                    Benjamin points out that the presence of duplicates emphasizes the value of authenticity of the original piece.
                    I think that elicits two opposing, but equally interesting responses in the world of digital media.
                    On one hand, I agree with Benjamin and his example of a photographic negative.
                    Authenticity in the form of an original record/file of a work can now allow for infinite reproduction of (nearly) infinite quality.
                    On the other hand, I believe he is also correct in stating of a photo negative that <q>ask[ing] for the 'authentic' print makes no sense.</q>
                    When a copy of a digital art piece is so readily available, in many cases there is no benefit to having access to the original (or to insanely high quality reproductions that only the authentic original can generate).
                    In this way, the value of any given copy of art is diminished while the value of the message or idea behind a given work is emphasized.
                    In my opinion, this is generally a good thing, but, practically speaking, I think it makes art for the sake of art less viable as an avenue for monetary benefit.
