separation of church and state makes sense for reasons other than the purpose of this document.

religion and government have exactly opposite structures. people CHOOSE to support religion while government requires citizens to obey. The line is blurring in this day and age when, if you don’t like your government, you can renounce your citizenship and leave. of course this isn’t true for all countries, but the most western and “free” countries, in fact, more closely mimic religious structure. Another interesting side note, so does the internet.
