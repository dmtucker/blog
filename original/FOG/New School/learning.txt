What School Taught Me

- Grades are the bottom line, so take the easiest classes you can find that meet your requirements.
- Grades are the bottom line, so cheat if you can do it without getting caught.
- I am only here because I have to be.
- Don't challenge yourself, the most prestigious institutions only accept the most talented students and the best cheaters.
