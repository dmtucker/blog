id say about 75% of my education came from wikipedia. whenever i need to know something, i just look it up, and it has never failed me. school acted only as a guide to things my generation can teach themselves. why force kids to learn things they don't want to learn and fail like most of our education systems today when you can let them teach themselves things they are interested in autonomously and save money while more effectively educating your population. people will retort "if that worked we wouldn't have done ____(capitalism) to begin with" but the difference is modern technology that was unfathomable when the economic and governmental institutions we have were put in place.
