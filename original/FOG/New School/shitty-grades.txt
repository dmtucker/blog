Perhaps excluding those classes particularly pertinent to my interests, I do not feel that my academic performance accurately reflects my full potential. To be honest, my goal has always been to get the most out of my time here at UCSC which has driven me to take heavy class loads in a variety of relevant fields. So far, I feel this has given me a strong, well-rounded view of computing systems, the communications & possibilities they support, the physics & logic that support them, and the areas within them I most enjoy studying. Since it is ultimately my interests that will drive my career and endeavors, the goal for me was never the grades but the knowledge & experience.
