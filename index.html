                <h1>GeoJSON ToolKit</h1>
                <p>
                    While working on my <a href="#SDP">Senior Design project</a>,
                    I found myself wanting some simple tools for working with <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> data
                    So, I wrote a validator and object counter and put them in a public <a href="https://github.com/dmtucker/gjtk">repository</a>.
                    There are currently <a href="https://github.com/dmtucker/gjtk-py">Python</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dmtucker/gjtk-js">JavaScript</a> implementations,
                    and they should be available on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gjtk">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/gjtk">npm</a>, respectively.

                <h1>Senior Design Project</h1>
                <p>
                    In response to a proposal made by <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/"><abbr title="Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory">LLNL</abbr></a>
                    for a system that could fuse data and interact with networked sensors,
                    our team built a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gsfdatacollecter/id886092582">mobile application</a>
                    and a <a href="http://gsf.soe.ucsc.edu/">web application</a> to interface a custom pluggable sensor and a remote database.
                    Gathered data can be merged with publicly available information (e.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>) to allow users to compare and relate large amounts of data.
                    More details are available in our <a href="original/SDP.pdf">poster</a> and <em>even more</em> in our <a href="original/OpenFusion.pdf">report</a>.

                <p>
                    As Fusion/Visualization Lead and Treasurer, I contributed code and graphics while managing our budget (approximately $2500).
                    More specifically, I built <a href="https://github.com/dmtucker/ogre"><abbr title="OpenFusion GIS Retriever">OGRe</abbr></a>,
                    a <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/OGRe">library</a> for fetching data from 3rd-party APIs,
                    and <a href="https://github.com/dmtucker/vizit">Vizit</a>,
                    a <a href="http://dmtucker.github.io/vizit/?data=example/test.geojson">visualizer</a> that can render any <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> file.

                <h1>Kahuna</h1>
                <p>
                    I basically learned by doing with computers, and <a href="kahuna/">Kahuna</a> is the machine I <em>do</em> on.
                    It all started with a <a href="http://support.toshiba.com/support/modelHome?freeText=555701">Toshiba Satellite A45-S150</a>, which I got on my (12th?) birthday.
                    Eventually, the backlight went out on that, and I failed pretty hard by trying to replace it myself.
                    After that I got some $300 black laptop that was straight doo-doo.
                    It crashed on me after only a few months, at which point my dad blessed me with a proper desktop, an <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c00838760">HP a1740n</a>.
                    Although I have upgraded this machine a number of times, it is nearing retirement.
                    I also use a 2010 MacBook Pro 15" regularly.

                <h1>Art 80F</h1>
                <p>
                    My final general education requirement at UC Santa Cruz was satisfied by an Introduction to Digital Media class.
                    One of the assignments was to create a <a href="http://dmtucker.github.io/art80f/">personal web site</a> that would play home to all subsequent assignments.
                    This blog was inspired by that creation.
                </p>
                <h2>Cancer Illustration</h2>
                <p>
                    Another significant assignment for the class was the Transdisciplinarity of Listening project which required each student to interview someone on an unfamiliar topic he or she was passionate about.
                    Then, I had to try and teach what I learned to others using some form of digital media.
                    I came up with an <a href="http://dmtucker.github.io/art80f/cancer/">interactive breakdown</a> of how cancer can affect the body that seemed to be very well received.
                </p>
                <h2>Dynamic Styling Tutorial</h2>
                <p>
                    For extra credit, I also gave a <a href="http://dmtucker.github.io/art80f/demo/">presentation</a> on the basics of layout rendering and the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>.

                <h1>Portfolio</h1>
                <p>
                    I would have to say my computer self-education took a top-down approach since I got interested in web development first.
                    Funny enough, <a href="https://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a> instigated my learning of HTML and CSS.
                    HTML+CSS led me to JavaScript which, in turn, got me interested in PHP.
                    By that time I took on some simple projects for local businesses.
                    Some of those projects are still up and running (see the <a href="#sites">site-selector</a> in the upper left corner), but, unfortunately, some are not.
                    I keep replicas of most of the websites I have developed to preserve and showcase my work.
                    Below is a list of sites in my portfolio with some description of the relevant history.
                </p>
                <h2>Bayfitted</h2>
                <img src="index/Bayfitted.png" alt="Bayfitted logo">
                <p>
                    <a href="http://www.bayfitted.com/">Bayfitted</a> was the first significant site that I ever built.
                    My good friend, Ben, told me that his uncle, Chris, needed a website for his custom art and clothing business in San Francisco.
                    Since Bayfitted did not already depend on a site, I was able to learn as I went for a real cause.
                    Unfortunately, school and other distractions often interfered with my ability to continuously maintain and develop the site.
                    Bayfitted is no longer in operation, but the <a href="http://dmtucker.github.io/www.bayfitted.com/">site</a> remains viewable.
                </p>
                <h2>Managing Life Transitions</h2>
                <img src="index/Joyce.png" alt="Joyce Freeman">
                <p>
                    After some success with Bayfitted, I convinced my grandmother that I could take over adminstration <a href="http://www.inner-calm.net/">website</a>.
                    We were able to obtain the source code of her site from the original developer, and I managed her web presence from then on.
                    In mid-2012, my grandmother moved from the Bay Area to northern Arizona leaving behind her 16-year practice, but her <a href="http://dmtucker.github.io/www.joycefreeman.com/">website</a> is still viewable.
                </p>
                <h2>Saroor Indian Cuisine</h2>
                <p>
                    Ben approached me again with an opportunity.
                    He introduced me to his friend, Prince, whose parents run an Indian restaurant in Walnut Creek, CA.
                    This time, Ben and I were pretty confident we could make some money from the deal, and we did!
                    I agreed to build the site for $300 which I split with Ben as a finder's commission for both Saroor and Bayfitted.
                    Prince and I have not recently been in touch, but I have continued to keep the site up and, until recently, even paid for the registration myself (albeit for <a href="http://www.saroorindiancuisine.com/">.com</a> instead of <a href="http://www.saroorindiancuisine.net/">.net</a>).
                    I intend to let the registration expire, but <a href="http://dmtucker.github.io/www.saroorindiancuisine.com/">the site</a> will remain viewable.
                </p>
                <h2>Austin Tailor</h2>
                <p>
                    My brother, who was trying to start a business at the time, approached me for help with a website.
                    His requirements were more than I had achieved before, but within my reach.
                    Balancing the beginning of my enrollment at UCSC with the development of this more advanced site challenged me in all the right ways.
                    Unfortunately, the business never took off, but the site remains (although it is not viewable because it is PHP-based, which GitHub Pages does not support).
                </p>
                <h2>Santa Cruz Sound</h2>
                <img src="index/speaker.png" alt="speaker">
                <p>
                    Freshman year of college, <a href="index/Krew.jpg">we</a> got <a href="index/zebra.jpg">rowdy</a>.
                    That tends to be difficult without <a href="http://www.santacruzsound.com/">great speakers</a>.
                    I found <a href="http://www.santacruzsound.com/">Santa Cruz Sound</a> online and correctly thought a barter was in order.
                    For <a href="http://dmtucker.github.io/www.santacruzsound.com/">the website</a>, we got hooked up big time... literally.
                </p>
                <h2>Sigma Mu Delta</h2>
                <img src="index/SMD.png" alt="Sigma Mu Delta Crest">
                <p>
                    Sol, one of my housemates during my 2nd year of college, was a member of the &#915; chapter of &#931;&#924;&#916;, a pre-medical fraternity at UCSC.
                    They needed some help with their website, so I worked with their webmaster to design a basic WordPress-based <a href="http://www.sigmamudelta-gamma.com/">website</a> that they still use today.
