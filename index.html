                <p>
                    Lately, I've been working on automating the setup of my preferred working environment.
                    It is a rather simple <a href="//github.com/dmtucker/config">project</a>, but, then again, that is usually a good thing.
                    Anyways, the only novel part (so far) is the <a href="//github.com/dmtucker/config/blob/master/customize.py">customization script</a> that allows you to customize configuration files when they are installed. This is useful for configs that require a password (e.g. <code>irssi</code>).

                    While working on my <a href="#SDP">Senior Design project</a>,
                    I found myself wanting some simple tools for working with <a href="//geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a> data
                    So, I wrote a validator and object counter and put them in a public <a href="//github.com/dmtucker/gjtk">repository</a>.
                    There are currently <a href="//github.com/dmtucker/gjtk-py">Python</a> and <a href="//github.com/dmtucker/gjtk-js">JavaScript</a> implementations,
                    and they are available on <a href="//pypi.python.org/pypi/gjtk">PyPI</a> and <a href="//www.npmjs.org/package/gjtk">npm</a>, respectively.

                    In response to a proposal made by <a href="//www.llnl.gov/"><abbr title="Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory">LLNL</abbr></a>
                    for a system that could fuse data and interact with networked sensors,
                    our team built a <a href="//itunes.apple.com/us/app/gsfdatacollecter/id886092582">mobile application</a>
                    and a <a href="//gsf.soe.ucsc.edu/">web application</a> to interface a custom pluggable sensor and a remote database.
                    Gathered data can be merged with publicly available information (e.g. <a href="//twitter.com/">Twitter</a>)
                    to allow users to compare and relate large amounts of data.

                    As Fusion/Visualization Lead and Treasurer, I contributed code and graphics while managing our budget (approximately $2500).
                    More specifically, I built <a href="//github.com/dmtucker/ogre"><abbr title="OpenFusion GIS Retriever">OGRe</abbr></a>,
                    a <a href="//pypi.python.org/pypi/OGRe">library</a> for fetching data from 3rd-party APIs,

                <p>
                    While trying to devise a better way of managing passwords for many digital accounts,
                    I came up with a memorable scheme that I implemented in an encrypted spreadsheet file.
                    Thinking it would help more people if it were a standalone application,
                    I created a <a href="//github.com/dmtucker/sentinel">web2py project</a> for a <a href="//courses.soe.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps183/Fall12/01">class</a> at UCSC.

                <h2>Keysmith</h2>
                <p>
                    I built an additional tool for Sentinel, a <a href="//github.com/dmtucker/keysmith">key generator</a>, for a <a href="//courses.soe.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps112/Winter13/01">comparative programming class</a> at UCSC.

                    I basically learned by doing with computers, and <a href="kahuna/">Kahuna</a> is the machine I <em>do</em> on.</p>
                    It all started with a <a href="//support.toshiba.com/support/modelHome?freeText=555701">Toshiba Satellite A45-S150</a>, which I got on my (12th?) birthday.
                    Eventually, the backlight went out on that, and I failed pretty hard by trying to replace it myself.
                    After that I got some $300 black laptop that was straight doo-doo.
                    It crashed on me after only a few months, at which point my dad blessed me with a proper desktop, an <a href="//h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00838760&product=3340229">HP a1740n</a>.
                    Although I have upgraded this machine a number of times, it is nearing retirement.
                    Very soon, I intend to build a new workstation from scratch.

                <h1>Art 80F</h1>
                <p>
                    My final general education requirement at UC Santa Cruz was satisfied by an Introduction to Digital Media class.
                    One of the assignments was to create a <a href="art80f/">personal web site</a> that would play home to all subsequent assignments.
                    This blog was inspired by that creation.
                </p>
                <h2>Cancer Illustration</h2>
                <p>
                    Another significant assignment for the class was the Transdisciplinarity of Listening project which required each student to interview someone on an unfamiliar topic he or she was passionate about.
                    Then, I had to try and teach what I learned to others using some form of digital media.
                    I came up with an <a href="art80f/cancer/">interactive breakdown</a> of how cancer can affect the body that seemed to be very well received.
                </p>
                <h2>Dynamic Styling Tutorial</h2>
                <p>

                <p>
                    I would have to say my computer self-education took a top-down approach since I got into web development first.
                    Funny enough, <a href="//www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a> got me intersted in web technologies.
                    HTML+CSS led me to JavaScript which eventually led to PHP, by which time I took on some simple projects for local businesses.
                    Some of those projects are still up and running (see the <a href="#sites">site-selector</a> in the upper left corner), but, unfortunately, some are not.
                    I keep replicas of all the websites I have developed to perserve and showcase my work.
                    Below is a list of sites in my portfolio with some description of the relevant history.
                </p>
                <h2>Bayfitted</h2>
                <img src="images/Bayfitted.png" alt="Bayfitted logo">
                <p>
                    <a href="//www.bayfitted.com/">Bayfitted</a> was the first significant site that I ever built.
                    My best friend, Ben, told me one day that his uncle, Chris, needed a website for his custom art and clothing business in San Francisco.
                    Since Bayfitted did not already depend on a site, I could learn as I went for a real cause.
                    Unfortunately, school and other distractions have often interfered with my ability to continuously maintain and develop the site.
                    I intend to return to this site very soon and simplify it to appear a more put-together appearance.

                <h2>Managing Life Transitions</h2>
                <p>
                    After my respectable success with Bayfitted, my grandmother and I decided the website she had for her Hypnotherapy practice was not worth the price she was paying.
                    We were able to obtain the source code of her site, and I managed her web presence from then on.
                    In mid-2012, my grandmother moved from the Bay Area to northern Arizona leaving behind her 16-year practice, but her <a href="//dmtucker.github.io/ManagingLifeTransitions/">website</a> is still viewable.
                </p>
                <h2>Saroor Indian Cuisine</h2>
                <p>
                    With 2 sites under belt, I was feeling pretty confident when Ben approached me again with an opportunity.
                    He introduced me to his friend, Prince, whose parents run an Indian restaurant in Walnut Creek, CA.
                    This time, Ben and I were pretty confident we could make some money from the deal, and we did!
                    I agreed to build the site for $300 which I split with Ben as a finder's commission for both <a href="//dmtucker.github.io/www.saroorindiancuisine.com/">Saroor</a> and Bayfitted.
                    Prince and I have not recently been in touch, but I have continued to keep the site up despite a migration from <a href="//www.saroorindiancuisine.net/">.net</a> to <a href="//www.saroorindiancuisine.com/">.com</a>.
                </p>
                <h2>Austin Tailor</h2>
                <p>
                    My brother, who was trying to start a business at the time, approached me for help with a website.
                    His requirements were more than I had achieved before, but were, what I believed to be, within my reach.
                    Balancing the beginning of my enrollment at UCSC with the development of this more advanced site challenged me in all the right ways.
                    Unfortunately, the business never took off, but the site remains.

                    I found <a href="//dmtucker.github.io/www.santacruzsound.com/">Santa Cruz Sound</a> online and correctly thought a barter was in order.
                    For the website, we got hooked up big time... literally.

                    They needed some help with their website, so I worked with their webmaster to design a basic WordPress-based website that they still use today.
